Awesome! minimalistic blog for Spree. It use markdown instead of html so no images or media are stored but linked.

**WIP**

_Note: Its a heavy refactor from the previous version so I doubt its upgradable._

## TODO

**high prio**

* add factories and fix mass-assign protected attributes in tests
* fix rest of port from older version
* update all views
* fix override so its hooked into admin
* fix assets
* apply [epiceditor][1] or cleaner like [jbt.gihub.io markdown-editor][7]
* fix tests
* remove locale keys that exists already in spree core
* change to strong_parameters gem so its more rails4 ready

**features**

* add ability decorator with tests
* add preferences to customize markdown editor
* better caching of posts and assets
* pingback
* social share (responsive and retina ready font icons)
* make it more html5ish

**if you wanna do it**

* make it upgradable from previous versions
* add other neat fatures
